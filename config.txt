To launch picom compositor instead of the default compositor in Arch Linux, follow these steps:

1. Install picom using the following command:

```
sudo pacman -S picom
```

2. Create a configuration file for picom by running the following command:

```
nano ~/.config/picom.conf
```

3. In the configuration file, add the following lines:

```
# Basic configuration
backend = "glx";
glx-no-stencil = true;
vsync = true;

# Opacity
opacity-rule = [ "90:class_g = 'Firefox'" ];

# Shadows
shadow = true;
shadow-radius = 10;
shadow-offset-x = -15;
shadow-offset-y = -15;
shadow-opacity = 0.75;

# Fading
fade-in-step = 0.03;
fade-out-step = 0.03;

# Blur
blur-method = "dual_kawase";
blur-strength = 5;
blur-background-exclude = [ "window_type = 'dock'", "window_type = 'desktop'" ];
```

4. Save and exit the configuration file.

5. Open your i3 or other window manager configuration file and add the following line to launch picom at startup:

```
exec --no-startup-id picom -b --config ~/.config/picom.conf
```

6. Save and exit the configuration file.

7. Restart your window manager or logout and login again to apply the changes.

Now, picom should be launched instead of the default compositor in Arch Linux.
